<h3>What this project is about!<h3>
<ul>
<li> -Spam Finder is a group project where we build an app that allows the user to pull and display data using an Abstract Api from incoming spam callers using an Abstract API, also being able to store data.</li>

<li>The Purpose of this project was a practical aproach to build an application using front and backend libraries and strengthening a foundation of working with others and working together.<li>

<li>Using real-time data from Abstract's API any functional phone number that is inserted into the application shall display data such as the phone number's carrier, approximate location, and </li>

</ul>

<h3>Project Takeaway</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In all a tech stack should be chosen to fulfill the need of a site. We came together as a team to use multiple libraries to the be able to put this application together. Building up are team-work skills and furthering our overall technical expierience!</li>
  <li>This project was overall gave a broader understanding on using the multitude of libraries and a better understanding of them.</li>
